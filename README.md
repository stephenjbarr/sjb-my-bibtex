sjb-my-bibtex
=============

My BibTeX file. This is intended to be a submodule for any papers I would write.

NOTES
======
+ Added ```filefilter.pl``` to remove ```file=``` lines from the BibTeX file. This is because where the file is stored is computer dependent, and makes syncing with Mendeley frustrating. And, it is not useful to me to have the location of PDF itself stored in BibTeX.
